# Advanced Bioprinting Simulator with Reinforcement Learning

The Advanced Bioprinting Simulator with Reinforcement Learning is a sophisticated and comprehensive project that combines the fields of 3D bioprinting and artificial intelligence. This simulator leverages the power of reinforcement learning to create a realistic and interactive environment for simulating the bioprinting process of complex organ structures, such as a detailed heart model.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: The core of the simulator is powered by a reinforcement learning agent implemented using PyTorch and Stable Baselines3. The agent learns to optimize the bioprinting process by interacting with the environment and making intelligent decisions based on the state of the bioprinted structure.

- **Bioprinting Environment**: The simulator includes a highly detailed and customizable bioprinting environment built using the OpenAI Gym (Gymnasium) framework. The environment represents the 3D bioprinting space and supports multiple material types, realistic physics simulations, and complex organ geometries.

- **Interactive User Interface**: The project features an intuitive and user-friendly interface developed using Streamlit. Users can control the bioprinting process, adjust parameters, select materials, and monitor the progress of the bioprinting in real-time through the interactive dashboard.

- **Visualization**: The simulator provides stunning visualizations of the bioprinted structures using Plotly. Users can explore the evolving organ model in 3D, rotate, zoom, and analyze the intricate details of the bioprinted tissues.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: The project incorporates a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics to assess the quality and performance of the bioprinted structures. Metrics such as Jaccard similarity, Hausdorff distance, volume overlap, and surface smoothness provide quantitative measures of the bioprinting accuracy and fidelity.

- **Data Processing**: The simulator includes utilities for processing and managing bioprinting-related data, such as loading and preprocessing medical imaging data (e.g., CT scans, MRI), converting between different data representations (voxels, meshes), and handling various file formats (e.g., NIfTI).

- **Physics Simulation**: The project incorporates realistic physics simulations to model the behavior of bioprinted materials. Phenomena such as extrusion, diffusion, and settling are simulated to capture the complex interactions and dynamics of the bioprinting process.

- **Customization and Extensibility**: The simulator is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. The codebase is well-structured and documented, allowing researchers and developers to easily customize and extend the functionality to suit their specific requirements and experimental setups.
